/**
 * This class is responsible for listening for new client connections
 * on the user specified port. On an incoming connection this thread
 * creates a new ClientConnectionThread to handle the communication
 * with the new client.
 * 
 * So how does the whole network code work?
 * 
 * Its probabely best to first describe the general architecture of
 * the network code. JFritz uses a client / server model, where the
 * information flow is controlled by server. All information is exchanged
 * asynchronously between the server and the client, with the exception
 * of the authentication protocol :). The server and client use object
 * streams to exchange information, the server sends DataChange objects
 * and the cilent sends ClientDataRequest, ClientActionRequest objects.
 * 
 * What code si responsible for what function?
 * 
 * The ClientConnectionListener listens for new connections on the specified
 * port in the options dialog. When an incoming connection is received, a new
 * ClientConnectionThread is spawned. This thread handles the authentication with
 * the client and then is responsible for listening for incoming requests
 * from the client. Once successfully authenticated the ClienConnectionThread
 * spawns a new ServerSenderThread, whose job it is to filter and send the data
 * to the client. The ClientConnectionThread communicates with the ServerSenderThread
 * by using a queue.
 * 
 * Once the the SenderThread is started the ClientConnectionThread registers
 * itself in CallerList as a CallerListListener, in the PhoneBook as a 
 * PhoneBookListener and as a CallMonitorListener. These Interfaces specify that
 * the ClientConnectionThread is notified (using various function calls) of changes
 * to the data to the phonebook and the call list. The ClientConnectionThread then
 * packs these Changes into DataChange objects and puts them in the output queue of the
 * SenderThread, that is if the client has the appropriate rights to reveive
 * the this iformation.
 * 
 * The client on the other hand communicates with the server using only one
 * thread, as writing objects to only one socket won't have a noticeable 
 * drop in the gui reaction time. Once connected and authenticated with 
 * the server, the ServerConnectionThread then listens for all incoming
 * changes, and depending upon whether the client should use the phone book,
 * call monitor and call list from the server and not use its own, the client sends
 * requests for reverse lookups, updating the call list to the server instead of  
 * trying to access a fritz box.The client also registers istelf as a callerListListener
 * and a PhoneBookListener and writes all changes to its personal data to the server,
 * however the server will determine whether to accept or ignore these changes
 * based on the clients rights.
 * 
 * How does the protocol work?
 * 
 * Upon connection the server writes a hello string in plain text containing
 * its name and version number, right now this is "JFRITZ SERVER 1.0". Then
 * the server writes the request for the clients login name, "login:". The
 * client then responds in clear writing its login name. The server then writes
 * the client the data key (the randomly generated key, that will be used to 
 * transfer data throughout the rest of the connection) encrypted using an
 * md5 hash of the clients password as the key (referred to as the auth key).
 * The client then decrypts the data key using its copy of the password.
 * The client then writes an ok response to the server, encrypted using the 
 * newly decrypted data key, currently this string is
 * "OK". The server responds to this string "OK". If either of the two
 * don't understand the others response, they close the connection, as
 * there has been a problem with authentication (most likely both passwords
 * don't match). If everything went alright the communication continues 
 * asynchronuously encrypted using the data key. 
 * 
 * The exchange of encrypted objects is done by packing regular objects
 * into SecureObjects. For the rest of the connection information is
 * exchanged on demand between the two. The Server does however send
 * keep alive messages to the client, currently every 60 seconds,
 * so that a defunct connection can be identified and terminated, or
 * restarted if wished. This is handled by the server, using the
 * ServerKeepAliveTask to send the keep alive string. The client then
 * has 30 seconds to repsond to the keep alive string.When either of 
 * the two want to end the connection they send the string "JFRITZ CLOSE".
 * For even more detailed information see the classes named above.
